This should only be referenced by the Api project itself.

It references other assemblies with the concrete versions of interface implementations that are only referenced by interface throughout the pipeline.

The consequences of referencing this in the pipeline would not be noticeable at first, but it would destroy the benefits of using interfaces in the pipeline 

for things like the Bus.
