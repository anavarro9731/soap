The classes in this assembly are lowlevel, they are used by Domain.Models which is shared
across many services. All contracts MUST be backwards compatible due to multiple versions
of this assembly ending up in the same class. And the classes that are put in here should be
simple utilities unlikely to change due to any refactoring of the other ServiceApi projects.
