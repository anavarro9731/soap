#Components and modules for building apps

Most components have a playground to demo the component and so it can be tested and investigated

To run a component's playground (run from /components):

```
./build.ps1 <component name>
```
Note: Component folders ```./src/[component folder]``` and JSX filenames ```./src/[component folder]/[component.jsx]``` must match
