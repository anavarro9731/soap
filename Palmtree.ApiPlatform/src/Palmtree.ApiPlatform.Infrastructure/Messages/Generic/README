if you want to create an aggregate you will just duplicate the fields, or place the object
as a child of this class, so why not make it generic and avoid all those classes. 

There is no impedance mismatch between
the contexts in the case of CRUD operations (the source of any change to the aggregate model
would always imply a change to the command) therefore this is a safe design and it encourages
a clear separation of concerns in the developers mind between CRUD operations and behavioural ones.
