The message base classes in this folder are here for convenience when constructing your
domain messages, it makes them cleaner to read. 

HOWEVER, DO NOT EVER reference these classes IN the MESSAGEPIPELINE Assembly.
The low-level interfaces must remain the only way you work with messages in that
assembly or you risk versioning conflicts when importing domain messages from other
services.
